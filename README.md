# unix-utils
This repo is for the Operating Systems course. It includes C programs that duplicate some unix utilites like cat, grep, etc.
All code was tested on: 
```Linux *** 4.4.0-22000-Microsoft #1281-Microsoft x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux```

To build, run the makefile of the utility. Each utility folder has a makefile which describes to the machine how to build the program.
Steps: 
    1- cd into the directory of any utility 
    2- Run : make <utility name>. This will execute the makefile in that folder
    3- The executable should be produced. It is named as the utiliy name without extinsion.
