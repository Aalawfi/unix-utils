# unix-utils
This repo is for the Operating Systems course. It includes C programs that duplicate some unix utilites like cat, grep, etc. <br/>
All code was tested on: <br/>
```Linux *** 4.4.0-22000-Microsoft #1281-Microsoft x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux``` <br/>

To build, run the makefile of the utility. Each utility folder has a makefile which describes to the machine how to build the program.<br/>
Steps: <br/>
    1- cd into the directory of any utility <br/>
    2- Run :``` make (utility name)```. This will execute the makefile in that folder and generate utility executable <br/>
    3- The executable should be produced. It is named as the utiliy name without extinsion. <br/>
